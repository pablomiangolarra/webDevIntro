Daniel Randal, UC Davis Coursera course: https://www.coursera.org/learn/web-development/ 

While HTML and JavaScript are very useful for web development, 
they don't exactly make websites look attractive - that's where cascading style sheets, or CSS, 
comes into play. While HTML is used to build the structure of our pages and JavaScript is used to 
provide interactive functionality, CSS is used to graphically design and layout webpages. By the end of 
this module, you'll be able to: discuss common mistakes in designing a website; identify and apply CSS basics 
like purpose and syntax; use CSS properties to control fonts, colors, layouts, and other common properties; 
differentiate between in-line, internal, and external CSS; and practice and test your cascading style sheets. 

This repository include all practice files created during the course.
